      <description>This guide will walk you through the steps required to build and publish multi-architecture Go binaries and package and release them to Github. We will demonstrate how this can be done manually through the GitHub user interface, and then we’ll show you how to automate the release process.
This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of Go and Docker, and that you have Go and Docker installed. In addition, this assumes that you know how to create and interact with a Github repository.</description>
